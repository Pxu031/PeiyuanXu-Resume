I'm detail oriented and thorough, I'd make sure that the project is completed correctly and would ask questions if I need help. I also have leadership qualities and as an example, I led my school's Hack4Impact club to develop websites for non-profit organizations. Additionally, I am eager to help others if I finish my work quickly and am always keen to learn new things.
